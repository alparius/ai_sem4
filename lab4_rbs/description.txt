1. THE ALGORITHM AND THE CHOSEN MODEL:

    We start by fuzzifying the two input float variables, the texture and the capacity.
    We obtain the membership degree of our input variables with respect to the different regions of the fuzzy variable.
    This is done using the trapezoidal region functions, which also work with triangle regions,
    because those regions were also given as trapezoids with b=c.
    Then we collect all evaluated rule-values into a list of tuples, and filter it, so we only keep the best value of each region.
    Finally we calculate the weighted average of the middlepoints of the regions, with these biggest membership degrees as weights.

    I choose the Mamdani model but I only calculate the area of the final model as a weighted average
    of the membership degrees and the middlepoints of their respective regions.



2. OTHER SPECIFIC INFO

    2.1 THE PROBLEM - The washing machine

        Design and implement a control module to adjust the washing cycle for a washing machine.
        The wash cycle (delicate, easy, normal, intense) depends:
            - on the texture of clothes (very soft, soft, normal, resistant) and
            - on the amount of clothes loaded in the car (small, medium, high).


    2.2 FUZZY REGIONS AND RULES

        texture regions:
            verysoft: (0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4)
            soft: (0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 0.8)
            normal: (0.3, 0.7, 0.7, 0.9)
            resistant: (0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0)

        capacity regions:
            small: (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0)
            medium: (1.0, 2.5, 2.5, 4.0)
            high: (3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0)

        cycletype regions:
            delicate: (0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4)
            easy: (0.2, 0.5, 0.5, 0.8)
            normal: (0.3, 0.6, 0.6, 0.9)
            intense: (0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0)

        fuzzy rules:
            ('verysoft', 'small'): delicate
            ('verysoft', 'medium'): easy
            ('verysoft', 'high'): normal
            ('soft', 'small'): easy
            ('soft', 'medium'): normal
            ('soft', 'high'): normal
            ('normal', 'small'): easy
            ('normal', 'medium'): normal
            ('normal', 'high'): intense
            ('resistant', 'small'): easy
            ('resistant', 'medium'): normal
            ('resistant', 'high'): intense
